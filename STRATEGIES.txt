                        OPTIONS TRADING STRATEGIES & EDGES
                              Complete Reference Guide
================================================================================

This document describes each trading strategy/edge available in the scanner.
Each strategy is based on documented market inefficiencies and has specific
conditions that must be met before generating a trade signal.

IMPORTANT: No strategy works 100% of the time. These edges are statistical -
they work over many trades, not every trade. Risk management is critical.

================================================================================
STRATEGY 1: TREND FOLLOWING DEBIT SPREAD
================================================================================
File: src/strategies/trend_following_debit.py

WHAT IT IS:
-----------
Buy debit spreads (call spreads for bullish, put spreads for bearish) in the
direction of a confirmed trend. You buy a closer-to-the-money option and sell
a further out-of-the-money option to reduce cost.

THE EDGE:
---------
When a stock is trending (price > MA20 > MA50 with momentum), it has a higher
probability of continuing than reversing. This is the "momentum factor" - one
of the most documented anomalies in finance.

Academic research shows:
- Momentum has ~0.5% monthly alpha historically
- Trends persist longer than random walk theory suggests
- Institutions and algorithms trend-follow, reinforcing the pattern

WHY DEBIT SPREADS:
------------------
- Defined risk (can't lose more than you pay)
- Cheaper than buying naked options
- Less affected by IV crush
- Selling the OTM leg reduces theta decay

FILTERS:
--------
- Price > MA20 > MA50 (bullish) or Price < MA20 < MA50 (bearish)
- 20-day return >= +3% (bullish) or <= -3% (bearish)
- IV Rank between 15-55 (not too cheap, not too expensive)
- RSI 50-75 (bullish) or 25-50 (bearish)
- No earnings within 10 days
- Options spread <= 8%, OI >= 500

OPTION STRUCTURE:
-----------------
- DTE: 30-45 days
- Long leg: ~40 delta
- Short leg: ~20 delta
- Max debit: 35% of spread width

EXIT RULES:
-----------
- Take profit: 50% of max gain
- Stop loss: 50% of debit paid
- Time stop: Exit if < 10 DTE
- Trend break: Exit if price crosses MA20

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE:
---------------------
- Win rate: ~58%
- Typical hold: 21 days
- Risk level: Medium

WHEN IT FAILS:
--------------
- Choppy, range-bound markets
- Sudden reversals (news, macro shocks)
- IV crush if entering when IV elevated


================================================================================
STRATEGY 2: IV CRUSH CREDIT SPREAD
================================================================================
File: src/strategies/iv_crush_credit.py

WHAT IT IS:
-----------
Sell credit spreads (collect premium) when implied volatility is elevated,
betting that IV will decrease and the stock won't make a big move.

THE EDGE:
---------
Implied volatility consistently OVERESTIMATES actual realized volatility. This
is called the "volatility risk premium" - the market pays extra for insurance.

Key facts:
- IV overprices realized vol by 2-4% annually on average
- Post-earnings, IV collapses rapidly (IV crush)
- Most options expire worthless
- Time decay accelerates as expiration approaches

WHY CREDIT SPREADS:
-------------------
- Collect premium upfront
- Profit if stock stays flat OR moves slightly your way
- Defined risk (unlike naked options)
- Theta works for you

FILTERS:
--------
- IV Rank >= 55 (elevated volatility - KEY filter)
- Post-earnings bonus (1-5 days after = IV crush opportunity)
- 20-day return < 8% (not too trendy)
- No earnings within 20 days
- RSI not extreme

OPTION STRUCTURE:
-----------------
- DTE: 20-35 days
- Short leg: ~25 delta (OTM)
- Long leg: ~10 delta (further OTM, protection)
- Min credit: 25% of spread width

EXIT RULES:
-----------
- Take profit: 50% of credit received
- Stop loss: 150% of credit received
- Time stop: Exit if < 7 DTE (gamma risk)
- IV normalization: Exit when IV drops

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE:
---------------------
- Win rate: ~68%
- Typical hold: 14 days
- Risk level: Medium

WHEN IT FAILS:
--------------
- Unexpected large moves (black swans)
- Sustained trending (wrong direction)
- Selling too close to the money
- Gap risk overnight


================================================================================
STRATEGY 3: MEAN REVERSION OTM
================================================================================
File: src/strategies/mean_reversion_otm.py

WHAT IT IS:
-----------
Buy cheap out-of-the-money options betting on a snap-back when a stock has
made an extreme short-term move (oversold or overbought).

THE EDGE:
---------
Markets overreact to news in the short term. When RSI hits extremes (<25 or >75),
stocks have a statistical tendency to revert toward the mean. You're betting on
this reversion with cheap options that can multiply if correct.

Key facts:
- RSI extremes precede reversals ~55-60% of the time
- Oversold bounces and overbought pullbacks are well-documented
- OTM options are cheap, so small moves = big % gains
- Asymmetric risk/reward (lose 100% or gain 200%+)

WHY OTM OPTIONS:
----------------
- Very cheap (small dollar risk)
- Huge upside if correct (2-5x possible)
- Defined risk (can only lose premium)
- Don't need to be exactly right on magnitude

FILTERS:
--------
- RSI < 25 (oversold → buy calls) or RSI > 75 (overbought → buy puts)
- 5-day return >= 5% in the extreme direction
- 20-day return < 15% (not fighting mega-trend)
- IV Rank < 50 (options not too expensive)
- No earnings within 7 days

OPTION STRUCTURE:
-----------------
- DTE: 14-30 days (shorter for faster theta)
- Delta: ~25 (OTM but not lottery ticket)
- Max cost: 2% of stock price

EXIT RULES:
-----------
- Take profit: 100% gain (double your money)
- Stop loss: 50% of premium
- Time stop: Exit if < 5 DTE
- RSI normalization: Exit when RSI returns to 40-60

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE:
---------------------
- Win rate: ~45% (lower, but winners are bigger)
- Typical hold: 7 days
- Risk level: HIGH

WHEN IT FAILS:
--------------
- Fundamental changes (stock deserves new price)
- Momentum continuation (trend > mean reversion)
- Slow reversal (theta kills you)
- Wrong on timing


================================================================================
STRATEGY 4: BREAKOUT MOMENTUM
================================================================================
File: src/strategies/breakout_momentum.py

WHAT IT IS:
-----------
Buy calls or call spreads when a stock breaks above resistance (like 52-week
highs) with momentum confirmation.

THE EDGE:
---------
Breakouts work because of:
1. Short covering - shorts panic buy, accelerating the move
2. Breakout traders - technical traders pile in
3. Media attention - brings new buyers
4. Psychology - resistance becomes support

Key facts:
- 52-week high breakouts continue ~60% of the time
- "Stocks making new highs tend to keep making new highs"
- Works best in bull markets
- Volume confirmation improves odds

WHY CALLS/CALL SPREADS:
-----------------------
- Leverage the upside move
- Defined risk
- Capture explosive moves
- Time is somewhat on your side if stock keeps moving

FILTERS:
--------
- Price > MA20 > MA50 (uptrend)
- 5-day return >= 3% (recent momentum)
- 20-day return >= 5% (breakout territory)
- Not more than 10% above MA20 (not too extended)
- RSI < 80 (not extremely overbought)
- IV Rank 20-60
- No earnings within 7 days

OPTION STRUCTURE:
-----------------
- DTE: 21-45 days
- Long leg: ~50 delta (ATM or slightly ITM)
- Short leg: ~25 delta
- Max debit: 40% of spread width

EXIT RULES:
-----------
- Take profit: 75% of max gain
- Stop loss: 40% of debit (tighter - breakouts should work fast)
- Time stop: Exit if < 10 DTE
- Breakdown exit: Exit if price falls below breakout level

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE:
---------------------
- Win rate: ~55%
- Typical hold: 14 days
- Risk level: Medium-High

WHEN IT FAILS:
--------------
- False breakouts (fakeouts)
- Bear markets / risk-off
- Low volume breakouts
- Buying the exact top


================================================================================
STRATEGY 5: IRON CONDOR RANGE
================================================================================
File: src/strategies/iron_condor_range.py

WHAT IT IS:
-----------
Sell both a call spread AND a put spread on range-bound stocks. You collect
premium from both sides and profit if the stock stays between your short strikes.

THE EDGE:
---------
Most stocks, most of the time, don't make huge moves. Iron condors exploit this:
- Stocks are range-bound ~70% of the time
- You collect premium from BOTH directions
- Theta decay works for you on both sides
- Even small moves in either direction are fine

Key facts:
- High win rate (70-80%) with proper strike selection
- Consistent small profits
- Works especially well in low-volatility environments
- Double premium collection vs single credit spread

WHY IRON CONDORS:
-----------------
- Profit from doing nothing (stock stays flat)
- Collect premium from both bullish and bearish traders
- Defined risk on both sides
- Wide profit zone

FILTERS:
--------
- 20-day return < 5% (stock hasn't moved much)
- 5-day return < 3% (recent stability)
- RSI between 35-65 (neutral)
- IV Rank 25-55 (some premium but not expecting big move)
- MA20 and MA50 close together (< 3% spread)
- No earnings within 25 days (CRITICAL)

OPTION STRUCTURE:
-----------------
- DTE: 30-45 days
- Call spread: Sell 20 delta, buy 10 delta
- Put spread: Sell 20 delta, buy 10 delta
- Min credit: 30% of wing width

EXIT RULES:
-----------
- Take profit: 50% of credit received
- Stop loss: 100% of credit received
- Time stop: Exit at 14 DTE (avoid gamma risk)
- Breakout exit: Exit if stock breaks the range

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE:
---------------------
- Win rate: ~72%
- Typical hold: 21 days
- Risk level: Medium

WHEN IT FAILS:
--------------
- Strong trending markets
- Unexpected news/events
- Earnings (NEVER hold through earnings)
- Flash crashes or gap moves

                            RISK MANAGEMENT RULES
================================================================================

These apply to ALL strategies:

1. POSITION SIZING
   - Max 2% of account per trade
   - Max 5 concurrent positions
   - Never risk more than 10% of account total

2. DIVERSIFICATION
   - Don't put all trades in same sector
   - Mix strategies (don't all be short vol or all be long vol)
   - Spread entries over time

3. STOP LOSSES
   - Always have predefined exit points
   - Never "hope" a losing trade will recover
   - Time stops are as important as price stops

4. EARNINGS
   - Check earnings dates before EVERY trade
   - Close positions before earnings (unless that's your strategy)
   - Earnings = binary event = unpredictable

5. LIQUIDITY
   - Only trade liquid options (tight spreads, high OI)
   - Wide spreads eat your edge
   - If you can't get filled at a reasonable price, skip it

                            HOW TO USE THIS SCANNER
================================================================================

1. Pick a strategy that matches current market conditions:
   - Trending market → Trend Following or Breakout
   - Range-bound market → Iron Condor or IV Crush
   - Extreme moves → Mean Reversion

2. Run the scanner with that strategy selected

3. Review the candidates - the scanner shows WHY each passed

4. Check the news for any upcoming events the scanner might miss

5. Paper trade first - track results for at least 20 trades

6. Start small - even if paper trading works, real money is different

7. Keep a trade journal - log every trade and review weekly
